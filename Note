Possible array question to ask?

1. Does it allow dublicates
2. does it take negative value
2. does it allow multiple  pairs that add up to the target numbers,(No only 1 pair of the numbers will add up)
will there be solution to the questions(No, There may not always be a solution, code solution shoulld be able to figure out if there is or not )
What to return if the solution is empty array- return Null

working solution For Array

Two pointer technique


2,

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the *maximum amount* of water a container can store.

area = l* w
where l = length(height) and width = distance btw two substance

[7,3,2,1,9]= 7 and 9 are the possible widest space of water,

4-0= distance =4 ==min(a,b)
distance * height = area of bucket
4* 7 = 28

where w = index (bi,ai)
possible formula = min(a * b) * (bi - ai)
